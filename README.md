# Welcome to the repo of Portio

This is a personal portfolio site built using Gatsby, GraphQL and Sass which holds information on a plethora of projects spearheaded and contributions by yours truly. 

## ðŸš€ Quick start

If you'd like to clone this repo and take a gander around its files, feel free to follow the steps below.

1. **Clone the repo (Or download the zip file)**
    Simple enough. Just download the code and extract its contents.

2. **Install Dependencies**
    Since this site requires a lot of libraries to get running, its best to ensure everything is installed. Bear in mind you will need [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and by extension npm pre-installed 
    Using a terminal, navigate to the root folder:
    ```shell
      npm run install
    ```
3. **Start the Development Server**
    Now that everything is set up, go ahead and spin up a dev server using:
    ```shell
      npm run develop
      # or instead
      gatsby develop
    ```
    Great! Now the server should be running on `http://localhost:8000`, or if said port is unavailable, the terminal should specify another port which was used instead.
