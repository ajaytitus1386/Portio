# Welcome to the repo of Portio

This is a personal portfolio site built using Gatsby, GraphQL and Sass which holds information on a plethora of projects spearheaded and contributions made by yours truly.

**Check out the deployed build at:** [Vercel](https://portio-eight.vercel.app/)

## ðŸš€ Quick start

If you'd like to clone this repo and take a gander around its files, feel free to follow the steps below.

1. **Clone the repo (Or download the zip file)**

   Simple enough. Just download the code and extract its contents.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Since this site requires a lot of libraries to get running, its best to ensure everything is installed. Bear in mind you will need [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and by extension npm pre-installed
   Using a terminal, navigate to the root folder:

   ```shell
     npm run install
   ```

   <br>

3. **Start the Development Server**

   Now that everything is set up, go ahead and spin up a dev server using:

   ```shell
     npm run develop
     # or instead
     gatsby develop
   ```

   **Great!** Now the server should be running on `http://localhost:8000`, or if said port is unavailable, the terminal should specify another port which was used instead.

## Keep in mind

- New fonts from fontsource are imported in `gatsby-browser.js`
